# Character Classes

A Character Class is a way to define the type of character you're going to play.  Much like classes in DnD, choosing your class has a loose-but-significant effect on your character's performance in the game.

A Character Class entry needs the following items:

- A _Name_
- A _Magic Die_ which is used as the base for any magical ability calculations
- A _List of Bonuses_ which buff/debuff main attributes of the character

## BURGLAR

The BURGLAR is a rogueish character who relies on smarts and speed rather than brute strength.  His time hanging out in... shady joints... has left him a little more sickly than he'd otherwise be.

Burglars have a base magic die of 1d6 and receive the following modifiers to their rolled attributes:

- Strength -1
- Intelligence +2
- Dexterity +2
- Constitution -2

## RANGER

The RANGER "looks foul and feels fair".  He has a limited degree of magical aptitude but mostly relies on light weaponry and armor for survival.  His time in the wild has made him a little hardier than most.

Rangers have a base magic die of 1d8 and receive the following modifiers to their rolled attributes:

- Intelligence +1
- Dexterity +3
- Constitution +2

## WARRIOR

The WARRIOR is big and strong.  He's not the brightest torch in the dungeon, but he can absorb punishing blows and inflict them in return.  His physical fitness keeps him much healthier than the average person.

Warriors have a base magic die of 1d3 and receive the following modifiers to their rolled attributes:

- Strength +3
- Intelligence -3
- Constitution +3

## WIZARD

The WIZARD is a master of the arcane... at least in training! Since he's been bookish for his whole life, he's not particularly strong or hardy, but if you need something conjured (or destroyed)... he knows how.

Wizards have a base magic die of 1d10 and receive the following modifiers to their rolled attributes:

- Strength -2
- Intelligence +5
- Constitution -2
