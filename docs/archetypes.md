# Archetypes

An ARCHETYPE is a combination of a couple properties of a [player](player.md): A [Race](races.md) and a [Character Class](classes.md).  You can label an archetype with two words (the race and class) like this:

```text
HUMAN WIZARD
HOBBIT WARRIOR
ELF RANGER
```

There are no restrictions on the combination - you can pair _any_ race with _any_class.

The ARCHETYPE is simply a class that combines these two in order to make them easier to reference in the [Player](player.md) object.
